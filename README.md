Asteroid

This is a portage of the famous Asteroid Game, but on my Template - a Pixel Game Engine. The goal of this project was to correctly manage the warped zone out of bounds for each pixel. This is the main gameplay of this game - an element does not disappear when it is out of bounds. It appears again on the other side. Technically the Pixel Game Engine fits exactly with this goal. The project uses my Template and a trick in order to create a single retro background music. Made during a single rainy day ++
